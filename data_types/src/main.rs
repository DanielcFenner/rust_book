 - Tuple -
 Tuples cannot grow or shrink in size
 let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

 We can destructure a tuple like this
 fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

We can index into a touple with .
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}

- Arrays -
Arrays in Rust are fixed length, vut otherwise work like you'd expect an array to.
Arrays can be annotated like this

let a: [i32, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

You can initialize an array to have the same value in each element.
This makes an array of [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

let a = [3; 5];
